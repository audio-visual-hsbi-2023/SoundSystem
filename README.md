# SoundSystem ðŸŽ¼

## Start System ðŸš€

As of now there isn't a good way to start the system from command line or script.
The best way is to simply start intelliJ and run the ```SoundSystem.oy``` file.

## Connect to System ðŸ’»

The Server communicates through the OCP protocol.

A simple UDP Client that sends OSC messages is enough to connect to the server.

Only a localhost connection is needed, but can configured to actually communicate over network.

    PORT: 8999
    URL: 127.0.0.1

These values can be configured in the ```src/server/SoundSystemServer.py``` file.

## Available commands ðŸ’¬

Each command consists of three sections terminated by a $-sign.

    command;string_value;numeric_value$

The command is one of the below listed ones. The second section is reserved for string values. 
Either a string of max 50 characters or an _. This depends on the command.
